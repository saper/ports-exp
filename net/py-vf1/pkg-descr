VF-1 is built around an interactive command prompt, and has a very "REPL"
feeling.  You only need a small number of commands to get around,
and most of them can be abbreviated to one or two chars, so with practice
you can get around very quickly.

You can safely unplug your mouse the entire time you are using VF-1.
